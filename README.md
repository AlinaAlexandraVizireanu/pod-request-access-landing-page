- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
- Receive an error message when the form is submitted if:
  - The `Email address` field is empty should show "Oops! Please add your email"

## My process

I've built this project using a Figma design file. In the first part of the project I've built the HTML code and in the second part I designed the Desktop, Tablet and Mobile versions with CSS. In the last part of the project I've implemented with JavaScript the form functionality to display an error message if the information inside is not valid.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In the process of building the project I've learned how to design the webpage with CSS with the help of a figma file and how to optimise the design based on multiple screen sizes.
